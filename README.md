This is a Node.js based private paint and text chat application. You just need an HTML5-enabled or any modern browser to use the application and start painting with your friends online!

Features:

-Create a new Drawing canvas: Attributes are Canvas Name, and a Canvas password. A unique Canvas URL will be generated for you that would be protected by the password you entered.

-Basic Drawing tools like Paint brush, color palette, and brush sizes are available.

-A text chat window on the right side

-Ability to save the canvas contents as a JPEG image.

-No database required, everything is stored on the Node server, for a specified amount of time.

-A new canvas URL stays valid for 1-2 hours(can be changed) if unused.

I'll add further details later.
Cheers!
